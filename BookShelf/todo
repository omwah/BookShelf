Edit: Okay, I seem to be having some problems with this. Books keep disappearing..

How: 1) Place one or more books inside bookshelf (we have several bookshelfs like a wall, not sure if that have something to do with it)

2) Right click lots of times quickly.

3) Books are gone. No error in log. No books dropped on the ground.

Remove WorldEdit ghost data (Books left behind in non-existant bookshelves.)
